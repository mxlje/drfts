We just stumbled across the quest for "the correct apostrophe". In case you ever wondered yourself, here’s what we found.
  
We started out with three alternatives: 1' 2´ 3`

Unfortunately **none** of them is correct.

While choice number 2 and 3 where dismissed pretty quickly, we had to look a little deeper to learn why the very common choice, number 1, is also not the correct apostrophe. Number 1 is a single quotation mark, a sibling to ".

The apostrophe that should correctly be used for the contraction of two words as in "it’s" is shaped like a nine, so it has some closing charakter.
On the QWERTZ keyboard layout it is <kbd>⇧ ⌥ #</kbd> (shift + alt + #).

As for the QWERTY keyboard layout, I’m a bit confused because you (as you in you people who use computers with a QWERTY layout) have this sign ' (number 1) as a designated key, giving you a " when pressed while holding <kbd>⇧</kbd>. However, this is **not** the sign you want to use.

I would expect the apostrophe to be in that place since it is so commonly used in the English language. 

As Wikipedia explains, the apostrophe got streamlined to the ' in sans-serif fonts.
Still, it is not the correct sign to use. But because it is placed such prominently on the keyboard, I fear most folks do get that wrong (and probably don’t care).
