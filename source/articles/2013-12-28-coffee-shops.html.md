It’s almost 2014 and I don’t get why most casual gastromy is so ill-equipped for what its customers are actually doing there.

I was recently sitting in a café and had a look around. From my observation, there are 3 main reaons why people go there. In order importance from my perspective:

1. Talking
2. Reading (and writing)
3. Drinks and food

## Talking
Most cafés are generally filled with people talking. Two options are possibly: You are either talking to someone in person or you are using your phone, tablet, laptop as a means of communication. 

Talking to someone in person is fine. Cafés aren’t clubs so the music level shouldn’t be a problem. Acoustics on the other hand are still a very negelected subject in public spaces as well as in homes[^1]. Believe me, I’m a trained musician and sound designer: even places that have great interior design often times have horrible acoustics which causes people to talk loud and having a hard time  understanding each other. 
You experience this usually as the place "just being noisy" and having a lot of echo. 
It’s simply bad design – *sound* design, in this case.

So optimize your coffee shop for talking if you observe that this is what most of your customers are doing.

## Reading (and writing)
Whereas you might still find people reading a newspaper, magazine or even a book while having a cup of coffee or tea, a growing amount of reading is done with an electronic device these days.

Writing follows a similar dynamic. People type on laptops or tablets – there’s also texting on your phone, but I wouldn’t necessarily call that "writing".

## Drinks and food
Although great coffee or pastry might be a good reason to visit a particular coffee shop, it isn’t the main activity. It may be *why* you go there, but it isn’t *what* you are doing at the place.

## So what’s missing? 
The way I see it, the main purpose of a coffee shop has to do with **communication**. And a big part of that is technology-based. If you want to make this as convenient to your visitors as possible, please consider to provide:

- Free wifi
- Power outlets (regular and possibly even USB)
- Some furniture that is suitable for the use of laptops

Now think hard. Which company has provided just that and grown its business massively (without having really great but surely fancy coffee) in recent years? Exactly.
And why do I sometimes (have to) go there and buy expensive coffee that isn’t even great, you ask? Because that brand fulfills the list above (and a lack of alternatives).
