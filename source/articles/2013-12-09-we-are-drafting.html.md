> Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it is because it *is* hard.  
> *– William Zinsser, [On Writing Well](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0090RVGW0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B0090RVGW0&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwimp09a-21)*

I was greatly impressed when I saw two original pages of the final manuscript of Zinsser's classic book that he shares in the chapter on simplicity. They are full of edits, crossed-out words and other improvements. According to the author they had already been rewritten and retyped four or five times prior to that last edit.
And then again – looking through the edits – they all simplify and streamline the text; they strip away the "unnecessary clutter". 

Here's an example, as I'm probably not allowed to share the images from the book:  
> "This carelessness can take on a number of ~~different~~ forms."  

It's this kind of clarity that we will strive for.  

So, welcome to [drfts.com](http://drfts.com), where we intent to do just that: write, edit and improve. There are two things to mention right from the start:

1. We consider these articles to be drafts in the sense that we will update and edit them.
2. We allude to the fact that everything published here is in an unfinished, possibly unpolished, state. This is intentional. It shall take away the excuse of not publishing.

If you've ever written and published, or "shipped" as Seth Godin calls it, you can probably relate to this.
We want to trick ourselves, not you, the reader. 

Welcome to [drfts.com](http://drfts.com) – we're finally drafting.
