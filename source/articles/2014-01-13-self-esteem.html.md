In "[Principles of Psychology](http://psychclassics.asu.edu/James/Principles/prin10.htm)" William James introduces the following formula to describe the mechanics of self-esteem:

> Self-esteem =  Success / Pretensions [^1]

##The basic math of self-esteem

According to this formula you can increase your self-esteem by either being more successful or by lowering your expectations[^2]. 

As success appears to be less within your control than your own expactations, one would think that curbing your ambitions might be easier – and at the same time a fairly noble thing to do.

The problem is, your expectations are neither absolute nor objective. Instead, they change in relation to your peer group, meaning people that you perceive to be like you. Our aspirations and expactations therefore, are ever expanding, like the metaphorical carrot on the stick hanging that you are seeing in front of you – always *just* out of reach.

##Everyone’s a winner
On top of that, the promise and premise to be able to achieve anything independent of your descent, background etc. is supposed to guarantee equality in modern culture, disseminating from the United States (also called the American Dream).

There is anectodal evidence of people "making it" despite whatever life has thrown at them. These stories are broadcasted by the media, marketers, motivational speakers, and so on. They are often received as motivating or even heart-warming. We, as the consumers of these stories, tend to wrongly generalize from them that we too can achieve anything which is known as the [survivorship bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

One downside of living in a meritocracy is the pressure or – to stay with the vocabulary used here – expecations this instills in the individual: If "Advancement in such a system is based on intellectual talent measured through examination and/or demonstrated achievement in the field where it is implemented", you get and earn what you deserve. If you can’t achieve, you must be lacking intellectual talent or effort, right?

##No escape
Now even when and while you are "on a run", gathering success after success and climbing up the ladder of personal and worldly achievements, the math won’t change. Look at the equation as a whole and you will realize that:

+ an increase in your level of self-esteem will most probably be reflected in and lead to more success(es) and/or higher expectations 
+ more success(es) tend to lead to higher expectations, higher self-esteem, or both 
+ higher expectations, as for example used in visualizing your goals, affirmations, the fake-it-until-you-make-it-approach, or attending a motivational seminar, might increase your chances of success as well your level of self-esteem 

It’s an **equilibrium**. If one of the factors changes, then the others  adjust in order to restore the equilibrium. It won’t get better – and it won’t get worse.

[^2]: When Alain de Botton mentions the formula, he uses the word "expectations" instead of "pretensions" which might be more common in temporary vocabulary.
